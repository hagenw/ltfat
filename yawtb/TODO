Here is the TODO list of things to improve, create, delete inside the YAWtb project:

- Using signal instead of their Fourier transform in various mfiles
(cwt<n>d, cwtsph, ...) and allowing the use of the fft with a special keyword 
(e.g. 'fft');

- Setting sampling period in cwt1d.m

- improve the documentation of morletsph.m and dogsph.c is really
  poor.

- check the documentation of cwt1dt.m and the associated spatio
  temporal Morlet wavelet.

- use k_0 (or a_0) and c_0 to control the 1dt Morlet wavelet instead
of k_0 and w_0.

- yademo fails with cwt1dt or movgauss: Comments are
  inserted directly in the code environment.  Note that in cwt1d
  comments were outside of this environment.  We probably need to
  move them outside of this environment.

- The norm L^1 or L^2 is not taken into account in cwt1dt.
 
>> mat = movgauss;
>> wave = cwt1dt(fft2(mat),'mexican',[4 5 6],[1],'order',4,'sigma',1,'sigmax',1,'sigmat',8);
>> yashow(wave,'filter');
The plot is not correct because we expect an anisotropic wavelet.

- The filter option does not exist with cwt1d.
