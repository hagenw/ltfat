Conditions to add your own wavelet packets

1°) The input argument of your mfile must be
	(kx,ky,mode,alpha, varargin)
So, you have the frequency plane (kx and ky), the mode of your function which 
can be 'infinit', 'scaling', 'wavelet', 'dscaling' and 'dwavelet' respectively 
for the return of the infinitesimal wavelet, the scaling function, the 
integrated wavelet and the dual of the last two. 'alpha' is for the definition 
of wavelet and dwavelet. It represents one of the integral bound which defined 
these functions. Note that this is 'varargin' which will contain the extra 
parameters of your packet.
     	
2°) Like for standard wavelets, your mfile must return the list of the 
extra parameters with corresponding default values if only the empty array 
is given as input argument. For instance,
        pmymexican2d([]) == {'sigma', 1}

3°) We suggest to begin your wavelet packet by a 'p' (for packet);

4°) If you want to avoid confusion with the 1d case, terminate the name of 
your wavelet packet by '2d'.
