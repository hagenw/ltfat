Welcome to the Yet Another Wavelet toolbox.


Warnings:
---------

This is the version 0.1.0 of the YAWtb, the initial release.
It is still an unstable version and a lot of work has to be done 
especially on the documentation (use YAWtb at your own, rather limited, risk).
Any comments are welcome on our mailing lists (see the YAWtb website)

A) Requirements
---------------

The YAWtb works for Matlab versions greater than 5 and was developped onto the 6th.
If you have some bugs, all emails are welcome at <yawtb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.
See the YAWtb homepage (http://www.fyma.ucl.ac.be/projects/yawtb) if you desire more 
information about this mailing list.

B) Installation
---------------

In the sequel, the '>>' symbols represents the Matlab prompt.

Follow these steps to install the YAWtb Matlab toolbox,

1°) Unpack YAWtb where you want (say the <YAWTBDIR> directory for simplicity);

2°) Compile all the YAWtb mexfiles (provided tha your 'mex' matlab script is well configured. See ) with the 'yamake' utility:
    >> cd <YAWTBDIR>
    >> yamake
 
    ( and for a more explicit compilation
      >> yamake debug )

Remark 1: If you have Microsoft Windows (9x, 2000, XP, ...), it seems
that the native Matlab compiler, and also this of Windows, are not
able to compile correctly the yawtb C code (e.g. cwtsph stuff). Use
instead the free compiler of Borland available at
http://www.borland.com (need a simple registration) and configure
Matlab in function (run 'mex -setup' and read the Borland compiler FAQ
and doc).

Remark 2: If you run Matlab on Mac OS X, yamake may have problems
since there is a bug between Matlab and the external (mex file)
compilation using gcc 3.x (specially in the C preprocessor). To
correct this, you have to install the Mathworks' patch given on 
	http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/data/35865.shtml
and follow the instructions written on this page.

3°) Run 'yaload' in Matlab to load the whole YAWtb path:
    >> cd <YAWTBDIR>
    >> yaload
    
4°) Add the following lines to a matlab startup file, either the general one 
    (matlabrc.m) located in MATLABDIR/toolbox/local, or the local startup 
    file (startup.m) somewhere in your home dir (see matlab doc):

    %% YAWtb installation
    olddir=pwd;
    cd <YAWTBDIR>
    yaload;
    cd(olddir);
    clear olddir;

5°) Enjoy of YAWtb !
