If you want to write your own 2d wavelet, take care about this README content.

1°) Yan can terminate the name of your wavelet by '2d' (e.g. 'mydog2d.m') to avoid
confusing with eventual 1d version of your function. In this case, you can use 
both 'mydog2d' and 'mydog' as wavname inside 'cwt2d'.

2°) This name MUST be in lower case;

3°) Be sure that your mfile return the list of the "parameters
names"/"default value" if an empty matrix is the unique input
(e.g. mydog2d([]) == {'w0',6,'sigma',1} );

4°) Enter a short description of your wavelet at the head to explain its use.
